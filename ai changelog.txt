-- ai changelog --
------------------
Last Updated 23 April 2019 by Bchamp and LBFrank
------------------

---- aimain ----
- Added rank2rush.lua tactic and filepath
- Added economyrush.lua tactic and filepath
- Added dotactic variable to allow for add-ons to force ai to perform specific tactics/build orders at game start

- Are less likely to scuttle lighning rods and generators
- AI desire more coal (25/sec compared to 15/sec)

- Adjusted desired elec rate to increase as the AI builds more foundries (workshops)
- Additional adjustments so that AI desire more elec.


---- armyanalysis ----
- Added analyzers for units for stink, flying artillery, deflection armor, loner, sonic, and Level 2 Rush units


---- basebuild ----
- AI can no longer build landing pad since it never used it properly.
- Electric Generator Upgrades are postponed/slowed down if Henchman Yoke hasn't been researched*
- Foundry is required to build a genetic amplifier*
- Require 8 active henchman before building second rod
- AI will only build 2 lightning rods before starting Level 2 research
- AI will build soundbeam towers to combat low level sonic units.
- AI will build 1 anti air tower for every 5 enemy fliers. Previously 1 for every 10 enemy fliers.
	- AI can also build more than 1 AA tower at a time now.
- Build research clinic only when comfortable (e.g. lab not under attack, have ample henchmen and creatures)
- AI may build 2 research clinics (randomly decided) but only one at a time.

- AI now expand across the map and build more workshops (foundries)
	- Number of desired workshops increases with each level
	- AI will not build a new workshop until all of its workshops are full.
	- AI now take into account whether or not they can beat an enemy attack on a workshop before fleeing and building a new one
	- AI will slow down workshop expansion to research henchman yoke.
	- Only build one workshop at a time.
	- dist2dropoff > icd_maxfoundrydist removed since it stopped AI from expanding on certain maps where coal was too close to lab.

- AI now build more creature chambers and build them further from lab to be more aggressive
	- Easy difficulty AI only build one creature chamber
	- Won't build a creature chamber before L2 if it's L2 units are amphib. Will instead wait for water chamber to be built.
	- Number of desired creature chambers is dependent on the number of foundries the AI has. This way AI build more CC's as game progresses.
	- Distance that creature chambers are built from lab is based on number of foundries.
	- AI can build a second creature chamber at L2 if it is doing well and comfortable.

- Only build electrical generator after two or more rods are present and after building a foundry.
- Water Chambers can now be built while AI is researching level that will require amphib units so that they are ready immediately upon ranking up.
- More water chambers are desired on water maps and more are built as the game progresses.
- Air Chambers never built before reaching Level 3


---- choosecreature ----
- Artillery units are now always accompanied by ranged units
- Desire more fliers on water maps. 
- Units with Stink Cloud are mixed with standard melee units.
- AI now recognize the utility of Flying artillery units and build them preferentially in certain scenarios
- AI now responds to enemy stink cloud and deflection armor with melee and fliers
- AI will not build loners ever.


---- creatureupgrades ----
- Function performed faster so that AI will complete upgrades more quickly with less delays between them.
- Only 6 units are required before AI will begin to upgrade them (previously 7)
- AI can now fully upgrde their units, previously only 3 upgrades were allowed*
- Hitpoints are now prioritized to upgrade and Area Attack Radius is deprioritized.
- 5 different Creature Upgrade Orders added, dependent on the creature's stats.
 > base upgrade order (the one originally present)
 > low melee base order (no melee upgrade)
 > 2 range glass orders (one with melee upgrade, one without, for low melee units)
 > melee glass order


---- flyerrush ----
- Previously AI would not expand when performing this tactic. That was removed.


---- henchman ----
- Henchman minimums and maximums adjusted and increased.
- Function runs more quickly so that AI build henchman faster.
- icd_gatherDist variables adjusted after bugs found on certain maps. Unsure what these variables do specifically, as adjusting them too much caused weird and unpredictable AI behavior. 
- Pre-L2 build order improved and optimized.
- AI will now agressively build henchmen to fill coal piles and workshop expansions* 
- AI will stop building henchman if it notices inefficient gathering (i.e. coal piles are running out of coal and 10 henchmen are mining one coal pile)
- AI now balances henchmen production with units production
- AI will queue no more than 1 henchman at a time at the lab*


---- holdfunctions ----
- No Changes


---- military ----
- Enemy are more likely to retreat when outnumbered by enemy
- Multiple tweaks so that current Research Level is incorporated into military decisions including which chambers to build units from and attack size.
- AI will make larger groups of Spam Units when attacking compared to regular units be requiring a theshold amount of "value" per attack group*
- Slow creature production if L3 but have not yet researched Henchman Yoke*
- AI are more aggressive, especially when winning*
- AI will queue less units at it's chambers so that it has more resources to spend on other things. 


---- rank1rush ----
- No Changes


---- research ----
- AI now research Henchman Binoculars but they do not reserach Henchman Heal
- AI only start researching L2 after obtaining desired number of henchmen. 
- Do not research L5 until advanced structures has been researched*
- AI will randomly decide whether or not it needs to build more units/foundries/research yoke before starting L3 or L4 research. Helps to slow down tech speed and increase military and economic expansion.*
- Will not perform advanced research before building a foundry before 8 minutes. Helps promote expansion and henchman building*
- Prioritize Henchman Yoke research over other research.
- Deprioritize Electrical Grid Research unless waiting for L3 to research to be completed.


---- researchrush ----
- Forcetactic added for compatibility with Add-Ons
- Lowered chance of performing tactic.
- RankUp and Logic_desiredhenchman functions added to better get to L3 faster. Needs tweaking.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------- NEW SCRIPTS ADDED TO BOOST AI FUNCTIONALITY -----------------------------------------

---- rank2rush ----
- AI can now perform a fast L2 build order and prioritize creating units.
- Will behave differently in a 1v1 battle as compared to a team for free for all battle.
	- Even more aggressive
	- Will only attack if it has a sizable number more units than enemy
- Will occassionally perform a proxy chamber rush by building a creature chamber outside enemy base.
	- AI will continuously produce and send units as they are built after the initial attack. 
	- AI will balance henchman production and economy with units to some extent
	- Will blow up chamber if rush is intercepted.
- Retreat more easily in presence of a soundbeam tower.
- Expand more slowly and prioritizes spending resources on units and combat.


---- economyrush ----
- Slow L2 build order 
- AI will build 15-17 henchmen (on a map with 5 starting lab coal piles) before starting research level 2
	- Also will build a workshop and generator before starting L2 research to get a head start on expansion

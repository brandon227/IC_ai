------------------
- Included Nandidd AI files
    - Restructered data/ai folder to accomodate multiple ai scripts and for them to be able to fight each other using ai_init.
    - For this to work, all functions must be unique and code should not be run outside of a function, except for dofilepath
- scout.lua now exists
- Improvements to AI leveling timing and requirements
- Henchmen build improvements, now added pauseLab flag to pause hench production to let the lab begin research
- Creature build order/tactic improvements
    - Proxy Chamber bug fixes to work on almost any map (hopefully) + better build order for expert. 
    - Fixed bug in economy rush where it would build hench forever, changed rush chance to 25%
- Fixed bug where AI spent twice as many resources on each level
- Research Clinic and Advanced Structure build requirement adjustments
- Adjusted military group sizes and other stuff I'm sure.

For Tellurian 2.9.1
-AI knows stink does not counter range
-AI knows that SB towers can damage flyers more
-AI will now build SB towers in response to digging units as well as camo
-Bug fixed where AI would not build workshop or creatures in certain situations
-Hard and Expert AI will research motivational speech when they begin researching L3 and are not under attack 

-EconomyRush Build Order improved with more variety. AI will sometimes expand even faster, not necessarily waiting to fill coal before next workshop
-Creature Upgrades improved so all upgrades are completed
-FlyerRush and L1 Rush added
-If population is maxed out, AI will not wait for more units to attack
-Bug mitigated where AI build too many henchmen

---- aimain ----
- Added rank2rush.lua tactic and filepath
- Added economyrush.lua tactic and filepath
- Added dotactic variable to allow for add-ons to force ai to perform specific tactics/build orders at game start

- Are less likely to scuttle lighning rods and generators
- AI desire more coal (25/sec compared to 15/sec)

- Adjusted desired elec rate to increase as the AI builds more foundries (workshops)
- Additional adjustments so that AI desire more elec.


---- armyanalysis ----
- Added analyzers for units for stink, flying artillery, deflection armor, loner, sonic, and Level 2 Rush units


---- basebuild ----
- AI can no longer build landing pad since it never used it properly.
- Electric Generator Upgrades are postponed/slowed down if Henchman Yoke hasn't been researched*
- Foundry is required to build a genetic amplifier*
- Require 8 active henchman before building second rod
- AI will only build 2 lightning rods before starting Level 2 research
- AI will build soundbeam towers to combat low level sonic units.
- AI will build 1 anti air tower for every 5 enemy fliers. Previously 1 for every 10 enemy fliers.
	- AI can also build more than 1 AA tower at a time now.
- Build research clinic only when comfortable (e.g. lab not under attack, have ample henchmen and creatures)
- AI may build 2 research clinics (randomly decided) but only one at a time.

- AI now expand across the map and build more workshops (foundries)
	- Number of desired workshops increases with each level
	- AI will not build a new workshop until all of its workshops are full.
	- AI now take into account whether or not they can beat an enemy attack on a workshop before fleeing and building a new one
	- AI will slow down workshop expansion to research henchman yoke.
	- Only build one workshop at a time.
	- dist2dropoff > icd_maxfoundrydist removed since it stopped AI from expanding on certain maps where coal was too close to lab.

- AI now build more creature chambers and build them further from lab to be more aggressive
	- Easy difficulty AI only build one creature chamber
	- Won't build a creature chamber before L2 if it's L2 units are amphib. Will instead wait for water chamber to be built.
	- Number of desired creature chambers is dependent on the number of foundries the AI has. This way AI build more CC's as game progresses.
	- Distance that creature chambers are built from lab is based on number of foundries.
	- AI can build a second creature chamber at L2 if it is doing well and comfortable.

- Only build electrical generator after two or more rods are present and after building a foundry.
- Water Chambers can now be built while AI is researching level that will require amphib units so that they are ready immediately upon ranking up.
- More water chambers are desired on water maps and more are built as the game progresses.
- Air Chambers never built before reaching Level 3
- Normal and Easy Difficulty AI adjusted to accomodate for changes to Hard and Expert levels of difficulty. Do not build as many workshops or do as much research as Hard or Expert AI.


---- choosecreature ----
- Artillery units are now always accompanied by ranged units
- Desire more fliers on water maps. 
- Units with Stink Cloud are mixed with standard melee units.
- AI now recognize the utility of Flying artillery units and build them preferentially in certain scenarios
- AI now responds to enemy stink cloud and deflection armor with melee and fliers
- AI will not build loners ever.


---- creatureupgrades ----
- Function performed faster so that AI will complete upgrades more quickly with less delays between them.
- Only 6 units are required before AI will begin to upgrade them (previously 7)
- AI can now fully upgrde their units, previously only 3 upgrades were allowed*
- Hitpoints are now prioritized to upgrade and Area Attack Radius is deprioritized.
- 5 different Creature Upgrade Orders added, dependent on the creature's stats.
 > base upgrade order (the one originally present)
 > low melee base order (no melee upgrade)
 > 2 range glass orders (one with melee upgrade, one without, for low melee units)
 > melee glass order


---- flyerrush ----
- Previously AI would not expand when performing this tactic. Now they do.


---- henchman ----
- Henchman minimums and maximums adjusted and increased.
- Function runs more quickly so that AI build henchman faster.
- icd_gatherDist variables adjusted after bugs found on certain maps. Unsure what these variables do specifically, as adjusting them too much caused weird and unpredictable AI behavior. 
- Pre-L2 build order improved and optimized.
- AI will now agressively build henchmen to fill coal piles and workshop expansions* 
- AI will stop building henchman if it notices inefficient gathering (i.e. coal piles are running out of coal and 10 henchmen are mining one coal pile)
- AI now balances henchmen production with units production
- AI will queue no more than 1 henchman at a time at the lab*


---- holdfunctions ----
- No Changes


---- military ----
- Enemy are more likely to retreat when outnumbered by enemy
- Multiple tweaks so that current Research Level is incorporated into military decisions including which chambers to build units from and attack size.
- AI will make larger groups of Spam Units when attacking compared to regular units be requiring a theshold amount of "value" per attack group*
- Slow creature production if L3 but have not yet researched Henchman Yoke*
- AI are more aggressive, especially when winning*
- AI will queue less units at it's chambers so that it has more resources to spend on other things. 
- When lab under attack, AI will only queue a maximum of 2 units at defensive chamber before beginning to build at other chambers.


---- rank1rush ----
- No Changes


---- research ----
- AI now research Henchman Binoculars but they do not reserach Henchman Heal
- AI only start researching L2 after obtaining desired number of henchmen. 
- Do not research L5 until advanced structures has been researched*
- AI will randomly decide whether or not it needs to build more units/foundries/research yoke before starting L3 or L4 research. Helps to slow down tech speed and increase military and economic expansion.*
- Will not perform advanced research before building a foundry before 8 minutes. Helps promote expansion and henchman building*
- Prioritize Henchman Yoke research over other research.
- Deprioritize Electrical Grid Research unless waiting for L3 to research to be completed.


---- researchrush ----
- Forcetactic added for compatibility with Add-Ons
- Lowered chance of performing tactic.
- RankUp and Logic_desiredhenchman functions added to better get to L3 faster. Needs tweaking.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------- NEW SCRIPTS ADDED TO BOOST AI FUNCTIONALITY -----------------------------------------

---- rank2rush ----
- AI can now perform a fast L2 build order and prioritize creating units.
- Will behave differently in a 1v1 battle as compared to a team for free for all battle.
	- Even more aggressive
	- Will only attack if it has a sizable number more units than enemy
- Will occassionally perform a proxy chamber rush by building a creature chamber outside enemy base.
	- AI will continuously produce and send units as they are built after the initial attack. 
	- AI will balance henchman production and economy with units to some extent
	- Will blow up chamber if rush is intercepted.
- Retreat more easily in presence of a soundbeam tower.
- Expand more slowly and prioritizes spending resources on units and combat.


---- economyrush ----
- Slow L2 build order 
- AI will build 15-17 henchmen (on a map with 5 starting lab coal piles) before starting research level 2
	- Also will build a workshop and generator before starting L2 research to get a head start on expansion
